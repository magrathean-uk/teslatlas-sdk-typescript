# Teslatlas TypeScript SDK

Follow `../AGENTS.md` and `../docs/development/COORDINATION.md`, then this
product's `docs/development/PLAN.md` and `STATUS.json`. Model and effort defaults
are in `../AGENTS.md`. Work only on the assigned scope. App v7 (`../app`) consumes
this product; change the App only as App work. Viewer is excluded.

Run commands through `../scripts/dev/run.sh teslatlas-sdk-typescript COMMAND...` so build output and
caches stay out of this tree (clean-development routes the npm cache; see `.clean-development.json`).

This repository owns public browser and Node.js transport bindings.

- Use `camelCase` TypeScript names and lowercase-hyphenated documentation names.
- Derive public types from released protocol artifacts.
- Keep credential storage caller-owned and browser-safe.
- Preserve cursors, ETags, SSE replay, typed errors, and non-idempotent command safety.
- Do not add viewer UI, Hub implementation, or server-held credentials.

## Local execution

Run task-relevant disposable local checks and repair failures without repeated approval when the lane is open. Existing owner pauses, workspace authority, production and release gates remain in force.
